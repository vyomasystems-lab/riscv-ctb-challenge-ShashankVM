## Creation of the YAML File:
Copied over from instructions challenge, increased the number of instructions to 10000, so that the user function gets called the specified number of times. Added user function to generate illegal instruction exception. Calling user function 9 times to generate 9 illegal instruction exceptions because 1 illegal instruction exception is generated by default.

## Exceptions generation explanation
Referred to RISC-V assembly manual, searched for illegal instruction exception and found the instruction that generates illegal instruction exception.
